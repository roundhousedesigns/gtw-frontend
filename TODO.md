# Frontend TODO

## TODO

- Set up login cookie expirations, and a "remember me" option for a longer expiration
- WPGraphQL Persisted Queries: <https://github.com/Quartz/wp-graphql-persisted-queries>
- Saved searches
- Might not need MultiSelect component

## FIX

- [ ] Fix usage of `<FormControl>`, which I believe should be used on individual inputs, not groups of them. See <https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/form-control>

## Dashboard

- Home (cases):
  - Candidates saved
    - Saved Candidates widget + button to New Search
    - No Candidates saved, but saved/recent present
      - Search view

## Trivial

- Favicon (index.html)
