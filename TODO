# Frontend TODO

## Trivial
- Favicon (index.html)

## Mastering
- Improve chunking:
	- (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kBs after minification. Consider:
  	- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
  	- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#outputmanualchunks
  	- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.

## Dashboard
- Home (cases):
  - Candidates saved
    - Saved Candidates widget + button to New Search
  - No Candidates saved, but saved/recent present
    - Search view

## Scratch
- global override: <Select /> should have cursor: pointer maybe?
- find out if there's an extension for VSCode that's like a notepad for underneath the file list on the left
